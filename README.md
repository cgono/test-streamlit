# test-streamlit

Empty Streamlit app configured for Python 3.14 using the `uv` package manager.

## Current Status

This project is configured to use **Python 3.14**, which was recently released. However, some of Streamlit's dependencies (specifically `pyarrow`) do not yet have pre-built wheels for Python 3.14, which causes installation to fail when trying to build from source.

### Workaround

Until pre-built wheels become available for Python 3.14, you can use **Python 3.13** as a temporary alternative:

```bash
# Switch to Python 3.13
echo "3.13" > .python-version

# Update pyproject.toml to require Python >= 3.13
# Then install dependencies
uv sync
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14 (or 3.13 as workaround)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration and dependencies
- `.python-version` - Python version specification for uv
- `uv.lock` - Locked dependency versions (generated by uv)

## Usage

Run the app locally:
```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## Development

Add new dependencies:
```bash
uv add <package-name>
```

Remove dependencies:
```bash
uv remove <package-name>
```

## Note on Python 3.14

This project is configured for Python 3.14. Once the Python ecosystem catches up and pyarrow releases wheels for Python 3.14, you can update `.python-version` back to `3.14` and run:

```bash
rm -rf .venv uv.lock
uv sync
```
